# 🧮 Scientific Calculator Web App

This is a simple **Scientific Calculator** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I created this project to revise and strengthen my basics in front-end web development.

It includes not only basic arithmetic operations but also scientific functions like sine, cosine, tangent, and square root.
